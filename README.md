# Smart-Hospital-Management-System
The Smart Hospital Management System is a console-based application designed to manage hospital operations effectively. It allows hospital staff to handle patient admissions, discharges, and record-keeping efficiently. The system combines a queue data structure for handling patient flow and a binary search tree (BST) for maintaining patient records, ensuring fast and reliable data storage and retrieval.

Search Patient Record:
